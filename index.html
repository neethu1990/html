    <p><b>MERN Stack: MERN Stack</b> is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. <b> MERN </b> comprises of 4 technologies namely:<b> MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js</b>. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.

        Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a big part in the development of web applications.
        
        </p>

        <h3>Getting to know MERN Stack components:  </h3>

            <h4>1. MongoDB: Cross-platform Document-Oriented Database </h4>
                <p><b> MongoDB </b>is a <b>NoSQL</b> database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables, etc. Documents that are identifiable by a primary key make up the basic unit of MongoDB. Once MongoDB is installed, users can make use of Mongo shell as well. Mongo shell provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can interact and carry out operations (eg: querying, updating records, deleting records).</p> <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.GqTQoNGlUmcUR0dCzl6FwgHaCf?w=302&h=118&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" alt="">

            <h3>2. Express: Back-End Framework: </h3>
                <p> Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code. Express helps in designing great web applications and APIs. Express supports many middlewares which makes the code shorter and easier to write.</p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th?q=What+Is+Express.js&dc=2&w=100&h=100&c=1&rs=1&qlt=90&cb=1&pid=InlineBlock&mkt=en-IN&cc=IN&setlang=en&adlt=moderate&t=1&mw=247" alt="">

            <h4>3. React: Front-End Library </h4>
                <p><b>  React</b> is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. React allows users to code in JavaScript and create UI components. </p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.CfRs_OXxTTZw-7e-bhb1uQHaEr?w=276&h=180&c=7&r=0&o=5&pid=1.7" alt="">

            <h4>4. Node.js: JS Runtime Environment </h4>
                <p> Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser). Node pack manager i.e. npm allows the user to choose from thousands of free packages (node modules) to download. </p><img src="https://th.bing.com/th?q=Node.js+Coding&w=120&h=120&c=1&rs=1&qlt=90&cb=1&pid=InlineBlock&mkt=en-IN&cc=IN&setlang=en&adlt=moderate&t=1&mw=247" alt="">
